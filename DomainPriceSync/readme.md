These samples are from a domain and hosting service provider. The system can fetch prices from a few different sources and then use the cheapest priced option to register the domain/hosting account automatically. This makes pricing updates very smooth and a background process.

This script also helps the client automatically fetch new domain TLDs as they released.

The site was built using Laravel 8.
