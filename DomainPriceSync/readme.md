This sample is from a client who is a domain reseller. The system can fetch prices from a few diffrent sources and then use the cheapest priced option to registar the domain automatically. This makes pricing updates very smooth and a background process.

This script also helps the client automatically fetch new domain TLDs as they released.

The site was built using Laravel 8.
