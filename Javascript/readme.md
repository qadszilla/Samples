** Due to NDA, I am not able to share too much on this project; but references can be obtained from teh company if required **

This Javascript sample is from a SaaS project which works much like Shopify, but is Australian built and hosted. Anyone can create an account, register a domain and start selling their products within an hour. The project was built using drag and drop content editor to power wide variety of elements.

Each website hosted/created by this SaaS is able to share the data with a number of 3rd party systems for day to day ecommerce needs.

3rd party the SaaS integrates with:
Afterpay, Paypal, Stripe, Sqaure, Zippay, Pin Payments, BPay, Xero, Myob, Quickbooks, Australia post, Sendle, Facebook, Instagram, Google search console, tag manager and merchant center, Klayiyo to name a few.

All of these integration were created by me.
